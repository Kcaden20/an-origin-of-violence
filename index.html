            <p id="civil">They called it a <a class="text-hover-image" href="#civil" onclick="return false;">Civil War</a> fought by conservatives and liberals.</p>
            <p>Yet with the state supporting tradition and killing progress, it was more a massacre.</p>
            <p id="jorge">They say it originated with the assassination of <a class="text-hover-image" href="#jorge" onclick="return false;">Jorge Eliecer Gaitan Ayala</a>, the liberal presidential candidate.</p>
            <p id="man">Riots of rage sparked from the salt of tears as a <a class="text-hover-image" href="#man" onclick="return false;">man</a> who killed a man was killed by men.</p>
            <p>How could the violence reach the city? With its shining white concrete meant to stay pure.</p>
            <p>"This was only meant for over there!"" They might've said. Believing red should only compliment shades of green; natural or otherwise.</p>
            <p>All for our good neighbor's sweet yellow cravings. </p>
            <p>They deserved this. What was the state supposed to do besides choose a side? </p>
            <p id="years">Never mind the <a class="text-hover-image" href="#years" onclick="return false;">18 years of violence</a> prior in the countryside</p>
            <p>Never mind the conservatives coming to power two years prior.</p>
            <p>Never mind their leaders who spoke of law and order yet called to take the land back by any means necessary. </p>
            <p>That it was theirs.</p>
            <p>That the other side was the enemy. </p>

            <p>What does it mean to have an origin when all the pieces matter?</p>
            <p>Is it deciding one part matters over the others? Didn't they all come together to create the full picture of our being?</p>
            <p><i>La Violencia</i> happened half a century before I was born.</p>
            <p>Its pot had simmered for almost 25 years before that.</p>
            <p>The formation of a nation-state 100 years before that.</p>
            <p>The forcing of the few who'd survived first contact to lose their identity and farm the battleground for half a millenia before that.</p>
            <p>Those few included a few of my ancestors, who prior to assimilation had inhabited the land for so long that their origin story was the origin of the earth.</p>
